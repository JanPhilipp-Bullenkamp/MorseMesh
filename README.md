# Discrete Morse Theory in a nutshell

Smooth Morse theory enables to perform topological calculations on a manifold, by just looking at a scalar function on it. Translating this to the discrete case, discrete Morse theory (DMT) aims to do the same on simplicial complexes. While this also works for volume data, we are interested in unregular triangular meshes and thereby restrict to 2D surfaces that are embedded in 3D.
