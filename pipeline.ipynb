    "This notebook shows an example of how to pipeline the discrete Morse theory segmentation method to get results for different parameter combinations. It can be adapted to your needs and it saves time to to the evaluation in the same loop and only save the best results as well. This pipeline will create a results label txt for each parameter combination."
