### **3. Determine edges**

You can now use the two sliders in the bottom to determine the edges correctly. Just
move them and the mesh will update automatically. 

The upper slider determines a **strong threshold** which includes all edges surpassing this 
threshold, while the lower slider determines the **weak threshold** which adds only edges 
that are below the strong threshold, but above the weak threshold, therefore refining 
the result a bit.

Under *advanced edge detection* in the sidebar you can choose more edge settings, the 
only ones that might be interesting though are the "Separatrix density* which could be 
ticked to *All* or the *Extremal line type*, which can be switched between *ridges* 
and *valleys*.
